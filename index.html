        <p style="margin-top: 400px;">Going to space is just the beginning. It is what you do when you get there that matters. We build satellites and spacecraft that do amazing things in space for government and commercial customers. Lockheed Martin-built satellites give earlier warning of severe weather, connect troops on the battlefield, and deliver GPS directions to a billion people worldwide. As we look to the future, we’re driving innovations to help our customers do even more in orbit. That’s why we’re designing smarter satellites that operate like smartphones in the sky, with apps that can be updated in orbit so they can adapt as mission needs on the ground change. Your mission is ours. And as that mission evolves, we’ll be ready.</p>
